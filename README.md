# MTA-SA-screen-mirror
Screen, key and mouse inverting script for vehicles in MTA:SA

Be aware, mouse script still does not replicate original GTA:SA's camera behaviour.

## Installation
- Add mirror.lua to your map.
- Add "<script src="mirror.lua" type="client"></script>" to your meta.xml file.

## To Do
- Implement camera position including vehicle velocity vector.
- Implement processLineOfSight to avoid camera being rendered behind an object.
